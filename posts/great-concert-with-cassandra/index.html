    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Cassandra asked me several months ago to get her tickets to a concert for a band called San Fermin. She had been listening to their &ldquo;Jackrabbit&rdquo; CD (a lot) and it had become something of an obsession for her. I had only heard some of the songs from the album and they were pretty quirky (atonal instrumental stuff).</p>
<p>Well, we went last night. It was <strong>AMAZING</strong> I&rsquo;m a huge fan now. <a href="https://youtu.be/p0EThYO0mro">Here&rsquo;s a link</a> to my video of the first song here. The opening band was Devine Sweater and they were outstanding (a modern version of The Sundays). San Fermin (I still don&rsquo;t know how that is supposed to be pronounced) was sooo good. They have a lot of instruments and every musician is amazing. They sounded really good live and it was a complete joy. I brought ear plugs and probably should have used them (I fully expected to) but, after the first song, I had to take them out so I could, as Cassandra said earlier that day, plug into the sound completely. I&rsquo;m so glad I went.</p>
<p>Cassandra is my favorite person to go to a concert with. She puts herself so fully into what she is experiencing that it is a joy to just be there with her. So fun.</p>
