    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Today at around 4:00 PM I dropped Lisa and the littles off at Reagan National Airport in Arlington with 4 heavy suitcases filled with most of Cassandra&rsquo;s stuff. She&rsquo;s off to college at the U of U. I&rsquo;ve been dreading this all day; for the past couple weeks really (I couldn&rsquo;t really process that this was coming before that). It really hurts right now. I felt like this when Corryn and Milo left for college too, but this is harder for me. Cassandra is my youngest/littlest. I&rsquo;ve had so much fun spending time with her for the past two years we&rsquo;ve been in Virginia together. I remember a night in the Air BNB about 2 years ago when we were in miserable heat and the power was out. She and I watched the workers working on the powerlines right outside the townhouse windows. It was so fun to talk to her and be with her (Milo and Lisa were asleep). I remember all those morning drives to early-morning seminary where we listened to that stupid &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t Want To Go To Seminary&rdquo; playlist (which I now really like). I remember the hours we have spent playing computer games (Outer Wilds, TBW, FNAF) and watching TV at night after Lisa and Milo were asleep. I remember going to concerts with her (and often Milo) and the incredibly fun time I had just hanging out and talking with her. I remember it all right now. I remember all the other times I just wanted to be alone and watch TV or play my own computer games or do anything by myself and now I want to go back in time and tell that guy to wake up! What a fool!

<p>We often act as if nothing will ever change; as if the people we love will always be there and everything will always be the same. We get bored or annoyed with each other and, instead of making memories together, we make up excuses to be alone or to not have to be inconvenienced by the stuff we do for and with each other. That sucks. The sadness I feel right now with my whole family gone and my knowledge that my little P isn&rsquo;t coming back should remind me in the future to not be such a chump. It won&rsquo;t, but I wish it would.</p>
<p>If you ever see this post Panda, please know that I love you so much and miss the past eighteen and a half years we&rsquo;ve had together. I&rsquo;m sure we have lots of fun ahead of us too, but it will never be the same as it has been. I know you know that too. That makes it hurt even more.</p>
<p>I love you!
