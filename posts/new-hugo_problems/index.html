<p>So my initial goal with all of this is to put together a clean instruction list (and possibly youtube video) explaining the process of setting up a new blog using Hugo and Github hosting. I&rsquo;ve used ChatGPT to help me get going and have run into problems with the AI using older information or not be detail oriented enough in providing code into files where needed or a combination of both.</p>
<p>I still think it is pretty cool that I can get assistance like this though the process. My kids hate AI, and there are definitely problems, but it is helping me right now do something I&rsquo;ve wnated to do for a while but didn&rsquo;t know how. That&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>I had a new error this morning and asked GPT for help. I think that the problem wasn&rsquo;t what the AI thought was the real problem, but I believe I&rsquo;ve found the fix through its help on my own. AI partnered with human intelligence can be a powerful creative force.</p>
<p>Well, there is a lot to do today, so this has to be quick. I wanted to add another picture and find out why the last one doesn&rsquo;t show up when the post is clicked on, but does show up in the &ldquo;preview&rdquo;. That might be a problem to solve this afternoon or tomorrow after church.</p>
