I need to get posting photos figured out. I think I know how to post a photo, but I&rsquo;ll need to make sure it is sized correctly so I don&rsquo;t end up with this:



I&rsquo;m not sure if these bullets are working. Do I need a space in front or not. Here&rsquo;s a bit of a test:
is this bulleted?
how about this
only a couple more
if these worked, what about the first two with the spaces in front of the dash?


Numbering should be easy. I&rsquo;m guessing there is a lot of formatting going on though. It may be that this type of a blog is just too barren of features for me to feel like it is useful.
If longer text is being formatted correctly, that is awesome. I&rsquo;m also curious about spacing between these numbers. Does everything look just like it does in my notepad data entry? I really need to find some better markdown editor. I&rsquo;m sure there is something out there. If not, this could end up being a non-vaiable way for me to bring this blog back to the world. Again, even though I&rsquo;m the only likely consumer of this content, I&rsquo;d like it to look as nice as possible!
Now I&rsquo;m going to try to see how quotes work. Here&rsquo;s hoping it looks decent:


I put an extra space beween numbered item 3 and this quote. &ldquo;do things show up right if they are actually in quotes?&rdquo;">

<p>Am I still in the quote format or has starting a new line taken me out of that. I can deal with limitations, I just need to know them. Here&rsquo;s hoping I can get this thing working up to a standard that is acceptable!</p>
<p><strong>this should be bold</strong>
<em>this should be italicised (or is it italicized?). Spellcheck would sure be nice!</em></p>
