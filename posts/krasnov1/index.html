<p>If Donald Trump really were a Russian spy codenamed Krasnov (I do not actually know this to be the case), what would he do, if he wanted to remain in power and above legitimate question, to weaken the United States over time and help Russia? Do any of the things he has done (especially over the past 2 months) fall into the category of &ldquo;things an actual Russian spy elected as president might do&rdquo;? I think it will be interesting to track some of the actions this administration has taken that are actually harmful to the United States in some way and that don&rsquo;t appear to have any redeeming value (to the U.S.) or that might meet Russian objectives of destabilizing the U.S. while strengthening Russia&rsquo;s position in the world. I believe that it will also be useful to go back to 2016 and review what happened over those 4 years. I&rsquo;m sure there are books written about this stuff (I&rsquo;ll share as I find them), and tracking all of this may end up one of the purposes of this blog (this is purely for my own curiosity and enjoyment). I&rsquo;ll also point out, when they are noticed, things the administration does that show that I&rsquo;m actually correct and that Donald Trump is probably not a Russian spy codenamed Krasnov.</p>
<p>To sum up, I&rsquo;ll be posting and tracking things here that could be considered as evidence that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Trump administration is working to destabilize our county</li>
<li>The Trump administration is working to strengthen the Russian position in the world</li>
<li>The reasons for the actions or policies included as evidence do not have well explained alternative motives or purposes other than the two items above.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll learn how to categorize blog post topics for those who want to filter these posts out of their reading. Then, I start working on getting comments included.</p>
<p>Then again, if I&rsquo;m wrong, and Donald Trump really is a Russian spy codenamed Krasnov, maybe it isn&rsquo;t wise for me to put this post out for the public to see. I&rsquo;ll need to think about it.</p>
